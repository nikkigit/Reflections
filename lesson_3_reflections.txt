1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am ready with a final product/part of a working product i will push it to remote repository. 

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives us control on what/when to pull the comments.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks - when you want to clone a repository from one github account to another github account
clones - when you want to clone a repository from one github account to your local machine
branches - branches are available in repositories.
