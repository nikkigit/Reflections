1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i am ready with a final product/part of a working product i will push it to remote repository. 

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It gives us control on what/when to pull the comments.
