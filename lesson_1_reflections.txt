1.How did viewing a diff b/w two bersions help you spot the bug?
It really helped in finding the bugs quickly and easily, since it highlighted only the changes between two files. I didn't have to spend much time to find the bug with this process. 

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Yes, that would really help me revert back any changes that messed up entire file/program.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I have control over what versions/docs i need to save. It will not clutter up my docs with too many versions, which will not lead to any frustration to find the version that i am looking for.

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
That is really great to save multiple files in one commit, which will help to follow the files that were effected due to the changes made.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Using commit id's available from git log we can find the differences in two versions of file using git diff command.

6.How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Very much.

7.Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
